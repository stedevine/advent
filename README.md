Some brute-force solutions to the "advent of code" problems from December 2015 http://adventofcode.com/

I solved these problems for fun and to force myself to learn how to write code in language I've never used before (Python) in a new editor (Atom) on a plaform I've never coded on before (Linux).
Given that, there are probably examples of me using the language in sub-optimal/insane way. 

Also - there are almost certianly more efficient algorithmic solutions to these problems, but the inputs are so small that a simple brute-force attack works great.
